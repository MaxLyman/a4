            For our visualization, we used Metacritic Video-Game Data from a Kaggle user named BrunoVR.
            This data set is a collection of metrics scraped off the Metacritics website from 1995 to 2021.
            For our visualization, we wanted to look at three things: the change in videogame popularity over time,
            the changes in genera popularity over time, and the changes in developer dominance and popularity over time.
            To see the video game popularity and genre popularity, we decided to look at the number of games released
            per year throughout 1995 - 2021 and compare with the moving chart. We decided to use two graphs for developers'
            popularity: the moving bar chart and the line chart with popularity on the Y-axis and year on the X-axis.
            Both of these charts, we feel, give an accurate depiction of the popularity of developers and the prevalence of developers
            per year.
